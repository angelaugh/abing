        <ul> 
             <li>Verse 1: <br></br>
I'm runnin' away from where I'm from
Never can stay with no one
Lovin' you almost feels like somethin'
When no one's around me
You lost and found me
I was surrounded
With open, open, open</li>
<br></br>
            <li>Chorus: <br></br>
            Open arms (Ooh), open arms
You give me open, I'm so devoted
You keep me open (Ooh), open arms
I'm so devoted to you, to you, to you</li>
<br></br>

            <li>Verse 2: <br></br>
Spent your life bein' hopeless
Chokin' on insecurity
I know, oh, this is bad
But, please, put a leash on me anyway
Who needs self-esteem anyway?
I hate myself to make you stay
Push me away, I'll be right here (Here)
With open, open, open
<br></br>

Open arms (Ooh), open arms
You give me open, I'm so devoted
You keep me open (Ooh), open arms
I'm so devoted to you, to you, to you
<br></br>

<p><b><i>No matter what come between us, yeah, I decided (Ayy)
I'm forever ridin' (Ride), you're forever guidin' (Ayy)
Pull up on an opp, hit his curve up, slidin' (Brr)
Notice when you mad, ain't no words, just silence (Ooh)
You my favorite color, now you seein' every shade of me
You say that I'm trippin', I hit back like, "Where you takin' me?"</i></b></p>

<br></br>
Locked in for life, on God, no replacin' me
Consequences, repercussions, karma keep on changin' me (Ooh yeah)
For you I trust, face card, valid ID (Ooh)
C'est la vie, go to Paris, it ain't five-star, it ain't me
Over-solid, keep it concrete (Ahh), I'ma bet it on your whole fee
Just don't switch sides, I could buy a piece, your wrist AP (Ahh)
Through the ups and downs and all the heat
Take a turn and tell you what it be
Backshots make you feel relief, anythin', just don't you ever leave
<br></br>
I guess I gotta go (Ooh)
I guess it's time to go
I gotta let you go
(I'm so devoted)
You keep me open (Ooh)
Gotta let you go, gotta let you go
I gotta let you go, I must
You the only one that's holdin' me down (Ooh)
Only one holdin' me down (Ooh, only one)
'Cause you the only one that's holdin' me down</li>
